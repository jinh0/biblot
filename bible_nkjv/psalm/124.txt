A Song of Ascents. Of David. "If it had not been the Lord who was on our side," Let Israel now say--
"If it had not been the Lord who was on our side, When men rose up against us,
Then they would have swallowed us alive, When their wrath was kindled against us;
Then the waters would have overwhelmed us, The stream would have gone over our soul;
Then the swollen waters Would have gone over our soul."
Blessed be the Lord, Who has not given us as prey to their teeth.
Our soul has escaped as a bird from the snare of the fowlers;  The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
Our help is in the name of the Lord, Who made heaven and earth.
