To the Chief Musician. With flutes. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Lord, Consider my meditation.
Give heed to the voice of my cry, My King and my God, For to You I will pray.
My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord; In the morning I will direct it to You, And I will look up.
For You are not a God who takes pleasure in wickedness, Nor shall evil dwell with You.
The boastful shall not stand in Your sight; You hate all workers of iniquity.
You shall destroy those who speak falsehood; The Lord abhors the bloodthirsty and deceitful man.
But as for me, I will come into Your house in the multitude of Your mercy; In fear of You I will worship toward Your holy temple.
Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies; Make Your way straight before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is destruction; Their throat is an open tomb; They flatter with their tongue.
Pronounce them guilty, O God! Let them fall by their own counsels; Cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions, For they have rebelled against You.
But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; Let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; Let those also who love Your name Be joyful in You.
For You, O Lord, will bless the righteous; With favor You will surround him as with a shield.
