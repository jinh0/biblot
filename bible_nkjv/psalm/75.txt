"When I choose the proper time, I will judge uprightly.

'I said to the boastful, 'Do not deal boastfully,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn.
Do not lift up your horn on high; Do not speak with a stiff neck.' "

But I will declare forever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
'All the horns of the wicked I will also cut off, But the horns of the righteous shall be exalted."
