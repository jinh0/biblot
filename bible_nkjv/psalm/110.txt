A Psalm of David. The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."
The Lord shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies!
Your people shall be volunteers In the day of Your power; In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth.
The Lord has sworn And will not relent, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek."
The Lord is at Your right hand; He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath.
He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill the places with dead bodies, He shall execute the heads of many countries.
He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; Therefore He shall lift up the head.
