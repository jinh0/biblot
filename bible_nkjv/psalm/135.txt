Praise the Lord!  Praise the name of the Lord; Praise Him, O you servants of the Lord!
You who stand in the house of the Lord, In the courts of the house of our God,
Praise the Lord, for the Lord is good; Sing praises to His name, for it is pleasant.
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for Himself, Israel for His special treasure.
For I know that the Lord is great, And our Lord is above all gods.
Whatever the Lord pleases He does, In heaven and in earth, In the seas and in all deep places.
He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; He makes lightning for the rain; He brings the wind out of His treasuries.
He destroyed the firstborn of Egypt, Both of man and beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, O Egypt, Upon Pharaoh and all his servants.
He defeated many nations And slew mighty kings--
Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, And all the kingdoms of Canaan--
And gave their land as a heritage, A heritage to Israel His people.
Your name, O Lord, endures forever, Your fame, O Lord, throughout all generations.
For the Lord will judge His people, And He will have compassion on His servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, The work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they do not speak; Eyes they have, but they do not see;
They have ears, but they do not hear; Nor is there any breath in their mouths.
Those who make them are like them; So is everyone who trusts in them.
Bless the Lord, O house of Israel! Bless the Lord, O house of Aaron!
Bless the Lord, O house of Levi! You who fear the Lord, bless the Lord!
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, Who dwells in Jerusalem!  Praise the Lord!
