To the Chief Musician. On a stringed instrument.  A Psalm of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend to my prayer.
From the end of the earth I will cry to You, When my heart is overwhelmed; Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For You have been a shelter for me, A strong tower from the enemy.
I will abide in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings.  Selah
For You, O God, have heard my vows; You have given me the heritage of those who fear Your name.
You will prolong the king's life, His years as many generations.
He shall abide before God forever. Oh, prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him!
So I will sing praise to Your name forever, That I may daily perform my vows.
