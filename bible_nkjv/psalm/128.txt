A Song of Ascents. Blessed is every one who fears the Lord, Who walks in His ways.
When you eat the labor of your hands, You shall be happy, and it shall be well with you.
Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine In the very heart of your house, Your children like olive plants All around your table.
Behold, thus shall the man be blessed Who fears the Lord.
The Lord bless you out of Zion, And may you see the good of Jerusalem All the days of your life.
Yes, may you see your children's children.  Peace be upon Israel!
