A Song of Ascents. Those who trust in the Lord Are like Mount Zion, Which cannot be moved, but abides forever.
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, So the Lord surrounds His people From this time forth and forever.
For the scepter of wickedness shall not rest On the land allotted to the righteous, Lest the righteous reach out their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O Lord, to those who are good, And to those who are upright in their hearts.
As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, The Lord shall lead them away With the workers of iniquity.  Peace be upon Israel!
