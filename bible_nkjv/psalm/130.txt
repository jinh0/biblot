A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have cried to You, O Lord;
Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications.
If You, Lord, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand?
But there is forgiveness with You, That You may be feared.
I wait for the Lord, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope.
My soul waits for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning-- Yes, more than those who watch for the morning.
O Israel, hope in the Lord; For with the Lord there is mercy, And with Him is abundant redemption.
And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
