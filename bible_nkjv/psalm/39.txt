To the Chief Musician. To Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. I said, "I will guard my ways, Lest I sin with my tongue; I will restrain my mouth with a muzzle, While the wicked are before me."
I was mute with silence, I held my peace even from good; And my sorrow was stirred up.
My heart was hot within me; While I was musing, the fire burned. Then I spoke with my tongue:
"Lord, make me to know my end, And what is the measure of my days, That I may know how frail I am.
Indeed, You have made my days as handbreadths, And my age is as nothing before You; Certainly every man at his best state is but vapor.  Selah
Surely every man walks about like a shadow; Surely they busy themselves in vain; He heaps up riches, And does not know who will gather them.
"And now, Lord, what do I wait for? My hope is in You.
Deliver me from all my transgressions; Do not make me the reproach of the foolish.
I was mute, I did not open my mouth, Because it was You who did it.
Remove Your plague from me; I am consumed by the blow of Your hand.
When with rebukes You correct man for iniquity, You make his beauty melt away like a moth; Surely every man is vapor.  Selah
"Hear my prayer, O Lord, And give ear to my cry; Do not be silent at my tears; For I am a stranger with You, A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
Remove Your gaze from me, that I may regain strength, Before I go away and am no more."
