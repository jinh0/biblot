Praise the Lord!  Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, Who delights greatly in His commandments.
His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed.
Wealth and riches will be in his house, And his righteousness endures forever.
Unto the upright there arises light in the darkness; He is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
A good man deals graciously and lends; He will guide his affairs with discretion.
Surely he will never be shaken; The righteous will be in everlasting remembrance.
He will not be afraid of evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord.
His heart is established; He will not be afraid, Until he sees his desire upon his enemies.
He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted with honor.
The wicked will see it and be grieved; He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked shall perish.
