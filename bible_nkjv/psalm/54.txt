To the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments.  A Contemplation  of David when the Ziphites went and said to Saul, 'Is David not hiding with us?' Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me, And oppressors have sought after my life; They have not set God before them.  Selah
Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is with those who uphold my life.
He will repay my enemies for their evil. Cut them off in Your truth.
I will freely sacrifice to You; I will praise Your name, O Lord, for it is good.
For He has delivered me out of all trouble; And my eye has seen its desire upon my enemies.
