A Song of Ascents. "Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth," Let Israel now say--
"Many a time they have afflicted me from my youth; Yet they have not prevailed against me.
The plowers plowed on my back; They made their furrows long."
The Lord is righteous; He has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked.
Let all those who hate Zion Be put to shame and turned back.
Let them be as the grass on the housetops, Which withers before it grows up,
With which the reaper does not fill his hand, Nor he who binds sheaves, his arms.
Neither let those who pass by them say, "The blessing of the Lord be upon you; We bless you in the name of the Lord!"
