The Lord reigns; Let the peoples tremble! He dwells between the cherubim; Let the earth be moved!
The Lord is great in Zion, And He is high above all the peoples.
Let them praise Your great and awesome name-- He is holy.
The King's strength also loves justice; You have established equity; You have executed justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His footstool-- He is holy.
Moses and Aaron were among His priests, And Samuel was among those who called upon His name; They called upon the Lord, and He answered them.
He spoke to them in the cloudy pillar; They kept His testimonies and the ordinance He gave them.
You answered them, O Lord our God; You were to them God-Who-Forgives, Though You took vengeance on their deeds.
Exalt the Lord our God, And worship at His holy hill; For the Lord our God is holy.
