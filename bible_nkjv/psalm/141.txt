A Psalm of David. Lord, I cry out to You; Make haste to me! Give ear to my voice when I cry out to You.
Let my prayer be set before You as incense, The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; Keep watch over the door of my lips.
Do not incline my heart to any evil thing, To practice wicked works With men who work iniquity; And do not let me eat of their delicacies.
Let the righteous strike me; It shall be a kindness. And let him rebuke me; It shall be as excellent oil; Let my head not refuse it.  For still my prayer is against the deeds of the wicked.
Their judges are overthrown by the sides of the cliff, And they hear my words, for they are sweet.
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of the grave, As when one plows and breaks up the earth.
But my eyes are upon You, O God the Lord; In You I take refuge; Do not leave my soul destitute.
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, And from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, While I escape safely.
