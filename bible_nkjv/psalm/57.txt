To the Chief Musician. Set to 'Do Not Destroy.'  A Michtam of David when he fled from Saul into the cave. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me! For my soul trusts in You; And in the shadow of Your wings I will make my refuge, Until these calamities have passed by.
I will cry out to God Most High, To God who performs all things for me.
He shall send from heaven and save me; He reproaches the one who would swallow me up.  Selah God shall send forth His mercy and His truth.
My soul is among lions; I lie among the sons of men Who are set on fire, Whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let Your glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down; They have dug a pit before me; Into the midst of it they themselves have fallen.  Selah
My heart is steadfast, O God, my heart is steadfast; I will sing and give praise.
Awake, my glory! Awake, lute and harp! I will awaken the dawn.
I will praise You, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing to You among the nations.
For Your mercy reaches unto the heavens, And Your truth unto the clouds.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens; Let Your glory be above all the earth.
