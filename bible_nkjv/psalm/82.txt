A Psalm of Asaph. God stands in the congregation of the mighty; He judges among the gods.
How long will you judge unjustly, And show partiality to the wicked?  Selah
Defend the poor and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and needy.
Deliver the poor and needy; Free them from the hand of the wicked.
They do not know, nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are unstable.
I said, "You are gods,  And all of you are children of the Most High.
But you shall die like men, And fall like one of the princes."
Arise, O God, judge the earth; For You shall inherit all nations.
