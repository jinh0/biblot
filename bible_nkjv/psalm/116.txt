I love the Lord, because He has heard My voice and my supplications.
Because He has inclined His ear to me, Therefore I will call upon Him as long as I live.
The pains of death surrounded me, And the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow.
Then I called upon the name of the Lord: "O Lord, I implore You, deliver my soul!"
Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; Yes, our God is merciful.
The Lord preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.
Return to your rest, O my soul, For the Lord has dealt bountifully with you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, My eyes from tears, And my feet from falling.
I will walk before the Lord In the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I spoke, "I am greatly afflicted."
I said in my haste, "All men are liars."
What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward me?
I will take up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the Lord Is the death of His saints.
O Lord, truly I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have loosed my bonds.
I will offer to You the sacrifice of thanksgiving, And will call upon the name of the Lord.
I will pay my vows to the Lord Now in the presence of all His people,
In the courts of the Lord's house, In the midst of you, O Jerusalem.  Praise the Lord!
