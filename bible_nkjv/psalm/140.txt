To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. Deliver me, O Lord, from evil men; Preserve me from violent men,
Who plan evil things in their hearts; They continually gather together for war.
They sharpen their tongues like a serpent; The poison of asps is under their lips.  Selah
Keep me, O Lord, from the hands of the wicked; Preserve me from violent men, Who have purposed to make my steps stumble.
The proud have hidden a snare for me, and cords; They have spread a net by the wayside; They have set traps for me.  Selah
I said to the Lord: "You are my God; Hear the voice of my supplications, O Lord.
O God the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You have covered my head in the day of battle.
Do not grant, O Lord, the desires of the wicked; Do not further his wicked scheme, Lest they be exalted.  Selah
"As for the head of those who surround me, Let the evil of their lips cover them;
Let burning coals fall upon them; Let them be cast into the fire, Into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
Let not a slanderer be established in the earth; Let evil hunt the violent man to overthrow him."
I know that the Lord will maintain The cause of the afflicted, And justice for the poor.
Surely the righteous shall give thanks to Your name; The upright shall dwell in Your presence.
