Praise the Lord!  Sing to the Lord a new song, And His praise in the assembly of saints.
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; Let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
Let them praise His name with the dance; Let them sing praises to Him with the timbrel and harp.
For the Lord takes pleasure in His people; He will beautify the humble with salvation.
Let the saints be joyful in glory; Let them sing aloud on their beds.
Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, And a two-edged sword in their hand,
To execute vengeance on the nations, And punishments on the peoples;
To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of iron;
To execute on them the written judgment-- This honor have all His saints.  Praise the Lord!
