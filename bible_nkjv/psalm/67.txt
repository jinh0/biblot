To the Chief Musician. On stringed instruments.  A Psalm. A Song. God be merciful to us and bless us, And cause His face to shine upon us.  Selah
That Your way may be known on earth, Your salvation among all nations.
Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You.
Oh, let the nations be glad and sing for joy! For You shall judge the people righteously, And govern the nations on earth.  Selah
Let the peoples praise You, O God; Let all the peoples praise You.
Then the earth shall yield her increase; God, our own God, shall bless us.
God shall bless us, And all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.
