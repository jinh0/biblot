## About
`biblot` is a side project (currently on-hold), created with the sole intention of creating the fastest, most convenient Bible reading website. The most popular
websites for reading the Bible are old and quite a chore to navigate around. Loading the next chapter requires a complete refresh of the page, losing your focus
and making it cumbersome to skim through chapters quickly.

Enter `biblot`: the website is a single-page web application, and jumping through chapters couldn't be faster. You can search for a particular verse and it'll
appear right away. You can highlight verses by simply clicking on the verse number, and it'll be stored on your local device, no login required!

## Technology Used
- Backend: Node.js
- Frontend: React

## Checklist
- [ ] Search particular phrases
- [ ] Verse view
- [ ] View all highlights
- [ ] Move to `next.js` for superior speed.
